This is a Telegram Bot. Its intended purpose is to help people (that knew something about computer/data security), providing some security commands and functions
to act upon (hash parsing, base64 encryption/decryption; password saving, similiar to the algorithm when you write down you passwords in notebook to peek them later, etc.).

PLEASE, DO NOT CHANGE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY OF THE MODULES IN app/tools FILE, THEY PROVIDE MAIN BUSINESS LOGIC. ONLY CHECK THEM FOR BUGS (if you want to), BUT DON'T CHANGE BUSINESS LOGIC! 
If you found something working not as intendent or anticipated, give me a feedback by providing a pull request, or in my email: coolmarik1501@gmail.com
